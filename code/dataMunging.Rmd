This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Set working directory
Change this path as needed to run
```{r}
setwd("~/Dropbox/DataAnalytics/RugbyWC2015/code")
```


Necessary imports
```{r}
library(reshape2)
library(cluster)
library(ggplot2)
```

Import Data
```{r}
data <- read.csv('../data/rwc2015.csv', header = TRUE)
playerPositions <- read.csv('../data/playerPositions.csv', header = TRUE)
```


Quick exploration of the data
```{r}
dim(data)
names(data)
```
From this we can see that there are 4088 observations with 4 variables each: player_name, country, metric, value


Now lets look further into the data
```{r}
summary(data)
```
From this summary of the fields we can start to see how the data is organised in the file.
It looks like each player is represented by multiple rows of data, with the metric field showing which of the metrics is beeing show in this row.
```{r}
unique(data$metric)
```
As we can see from the above command there are 10 different metrics shown in this data.


As I continue with my analysis I would prefer to transform this data so that each metric is a variable and each row is a player.
For this task I will use the reshape2 package imported above

```{r}
new_data <- dcast(data, player_name + country ~ metric)
new_data_NAs <- new_data
```

Here is an short extract of what the data look like now
```{r}
head(new_data)
```
As we can see from the above extract NA was inserted where the values did not exist for a given player and metric. It looks like the NAs signify when a player has 0 of a metric, altough I am not 100% sure for this exercise I will replace NAs with 0
```{r}
new_data[is.na(new_data)] <- 0
```
The summary of the 10 different metrics' is now more true to reality
```{r}
summary(new_data)
```


I'm going to divide all the metrics by the number of games played by each player to remove bias of the number of games played by each player.
```{r}
columnsToDivide <- c(3,4,5,6,7,9,10,11,12)
for(i in columnsToDivide) {
  new_data[ ,i] = new_data[ ,i] / new_data$matches
} 
```


Finding the leader in each category 
```{r}
max_carries <- new_data[new_data$carries == max(new_data$carries),]
max_cogl <- new_data[new_data$carries_over_gain_line == max(new_data$carries_over_gain_line),]
max_cb <- new_data[new_data$clean_breaks == max(new_data$clean_breaks),]
max_los <- new_data[new_data$lineout_steals == max(new_data$lineout_steals),]
max_low <- new_data[new_data$lineouts_won == max(new_data$lineouts_won),]
max_mm <- new_data[new_data$metres_made == max(new_data$metres_made),]
max_om <- new_data[new_data$offloads_made == max(new_data$offloads_made),]
max_tries <- new_data[new_data$tries == max(new_data$tries),]
max_tow <- new_data[new_data$turnovers_won == max(new_data$turnovers_won),]
```


I'm going to try to use K-means clustering to see if we can group players by possitions by using just the 10 fields provided in the data. With K-means you have to specify the number of center to use for clustering I'm going to start with 9, one for each position: prop, hooker, lock, back row, scrum half, fly half, center, wing and full back 
```{r}


set.seed(1)
kmeansIn <- data.matrix(new_data[, -c(1,2,8)])
kmeansRes <- kmeans(kmeansIn, centers = 3)
```

adding a new column to the data to hold the number of the cluster it was assigned to.
```{r}
new_data$cluster <- kmeansRes$cluster
```


Merging the two different data sources to check the results of clustering on 
```{r}
merged <- merge(x = new_data, y = playerPositions, by.x = 'player_name', by.y = 'Player.name')
merged_left <- merge(x = new_data, y = playerPositions, by.x = 'player_name', by.y = 'Player.name', all.x = TRUE)
merged_right <- merge(x = new_data, y = playerPositions, by.x = 'player_name', by.y = 'Player.name', all.y = TRUE)

missing_left <- merged_left[is.na(merged_left$Pos), ]
missing_right <- merged_right[is.na(merged_right$country), ]
```
only 535 of 620 were matched. This issue seems to be caused mostly by small discrepancies in the names between the two data sources e.g. Apisalome Ratuniyarawa / Api Ratuniyarewa. For this exercise its ok to disregard the 87 missmatches, for other more important problems we could use a fuzzy string matching algorithm like the Levenshtein distance algorithm to match the strings that don't match exactly.

```{r}
kmeansRes$size
```

Lets look at a table of position vs cluster
```{r}
table(merged$cluster, merged$Pos)
```


Split the data into 3 dataframes one for each cluster
```{r}
clust3 <- merged[merged$cluster == 3, ]
clust1 <- merged[merged$cluster == 1, ]
clust2 <- merged[merged$cluster == 2, ]
summary(clust1$Pos)

```


***Cluster Plot
Create silhouette plot
```{r}
graphColors = c('red', 'green', 'blue')
dissE <- daisy(kmeansIn)
dE2 <- dissE^2
sk2 <- silhouette(kmeansRes$cl, dE2)
plot(sk2, col=graphColors)
```



***Exploratory Graphs

Comparing tries scored by cluster
```{r}
boxplot(merged$tries ~ merged$cluster, varwidth = TRUE, col=graphColors, xlab='Cluster', ylab='Tries scored per game', main='Tries scored per game cluster comparison')
ggplot(merged, aes(merged$tries, fill = as.factor(merged$cluster))) + geom_density(alpha = 0.2)
```
